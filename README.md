# Arduino_esp8266

This repo contains the arduino code for creating a web server using esp8266 module.

- The esp8266 module is used in mode 2, i.e. as an Access point. Hence, a hotspot is created.
- Then Arduino's data is sent to the server.
- Any device connected to the hotspot can go to the esp's ip address to see arduino's data.

The project aims to identify vacant and occupied parking spaces in a locality.
